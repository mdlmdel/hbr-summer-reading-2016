# HBR Summer Reading 2016 - Responsive Email

Released: Original emails sent on June 30, 2016, and follow-up emails sent in July 2016

Harvard Business Review (HBR) sent an email marketing promotion in June and July 2016 sharing a 25% off $40 or more promo in the HBR Store. I created and developed the promo from conception through implementation&mdash;working with colleagues in design, editorial, analytics, and marketing on the overarching idea, segmentation, list, and offer. I also worked with HBR's tech team to create a landing page that was the first unique landing page that accompanied an HBR ecommerce email marketing promo. The landing page can be found [here](https://hbr.org/store/landing/summer-reading-list). 

Conceptually, the email features free articles and books and bundles for sale that tap into the concepts of unplugging to get ahead, introspection, and developing one&rsquo;s leadership skills. 

The template is a responsive email developed with [Foundation for Emails 2 by Zurb](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html). I built the email using the CSS version of the framework. For brand consistency, I used the same design, styling, and spacing in the footer that HBR now uses elsewhere.
